Edmunds has expert and consumer reviews, nationwide inventory, and pricing information to assist in determining a fair price to pay for your used car. If you're looking for used vehicles from private sellers, however, you might want to search elsewhere. <a href=\"https://www.edmunds.com/inventory/srp.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic_search&utm_campaign=faq_zero_box&utm_content=link1\">Learn more</a>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What used cars not to buy?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"In general, you'll want to avoid used vehicles that have been issued a junk or salvage title, been in numerous accidents, or have a serious mechanical issue that needs attention. Edmunds does not have reliability data, so it is difficult to make a blanket assessment of specific models. There are a number of factors, such as age, maintenance history, and how the vehicle was driven, that play a role in determining a good car. <a href=\"https://www.edmunds.com/inventory/srp.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic_search&utm_campaign=faq_zero_box&utm_content=link2\">Learn more</a>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are the cheapest used cars in USA?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"You'll find used vehicles on Edmunds as low as $900. You'll want to sort the filter on the inventory page to the price range you want to look for, then sort by price from low to high. Keep in mind that cheap used cars might have items that need repair or they may have been in accidents. Make sure to get a vehicle history report and have the car inspected by a mechanic before making a buying decision. <a href=\"https://www.edmunds.com/inventory/srp.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic_search&utm_campaign=faq_zero_box&utm_content=link3\">Learn more</a>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do I find the best car?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The best car for you is one that is in good condition and in your price range and one that fits the utility needs for you and your family. You can determine if it's the right one by checking the vehicle's vehicle history report, getting it inspected by a mechanic, and test-driving the vehicle. Take a look at Edmunds research articles for more information on how to buy a new or used car. <a href=\"https://www.edmunds.com/inventory/srp.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic_search&utm_campaign=faq_zero_box&utm_content=link4\">Learn more</a>"}}]},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"BreadcrumbList","itemListElement":[{"@type":"ListItem","position":1,"item":{"@id":"https://www.edmunds.com/","name":"Home"}},{"@type":"ListItem","position":2,"item":{"@id":"","name":"Cars For Sale"}}]},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Product","name":"Suzuki","description":"Save money on one of 12 Suzukis near you.

mb-1">Everyone will have an opinion, but we happen to think Edmunds is the best used car website. Edmunds has expert and consumer reviews, nationwide inventory, and pricing information to assist in determining a fair price to pay for your used car. If you're looking for used vehicles from private sellers, however, you might want to search elsewhere.</div></dd><dt><h3 class="mb-0 heading-5">What used cars not to buy?</h3></dt><dd><div class="content-fragment answer size-16 mb-1">In general, you'll want to avoid used vehicles that have been issued a junk or salvage title, been in numerous accidents, or have a serious mechanical issue that needs attention. Edmunds does not have reliability data, so it is difficult to make a blanket assessment of specific models. There are a number of factors, such as age, maintenance history, and how the vehicle was driven, that play a role in determining a good car.</div></dd></dl><div class="content-collapse" data-tracking-id="view_content_summary"><div id="collapse:Rnq4q4i:"></div><div class="react-collapse --c-collapsed" style="overflow:hidden;transition:height 280ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);height:0px;visibility:hidden"><dl class="mb-0"><dt><h3 class="mb-0 heading-5">What are the cheapest used cars in USA?</h3></dt><dd><div class="content-fragment answer size-16 mb-1">You'll find used vehicles on Edmunds as low as $900. You'll want to sort the filter on the inventory page to the price range you want to look for, then sort by price from low to high. Keep in mind that cheap used cars might have items that need repair or they may have been in accidents. Make sure to get a vehicle history report and have the car inspected by a mechanic before making a buying decision.</div></dd><dt><h3 class="mb-0 heading-5">How do I find the best car?</h3></dt><dd><div class="content-fragment answer size-16 mb-1">The best car for you is one that is in good condition and in your price range and one that fits the utility needs for you and your family. You can determine if it's the right one by checking the vehicle's vehicle history report, getting it inspected by a mechanic, and test-driving the vehicle. Take a look at Edmunds research articles for more information on how to buy a new or used car.</div></dd></dl></div><div class="collapse-control mb-0 row align-items-center justify-content-start py-0"><button aria-expanded="false" class="content-collapse-button px-0_5 py-0 size-16 text-primary-darker btn btn-link btn-sm" data-no-refresh="true" data-tracking-ignore-value="true" type="button"><span class="control-text font-weight-normal">Read more</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="size-10 mb-0 icon-arrow-down4"></span></button></div></div></section></section></div></div><div class="mt-2 text-cool-gray-40"><p class="size-12">** This image is a stock photo and may not reflect the model year or color of, and/or equipment offered on, the advertised vehicle.</p></div></div></div></main><div class="global-footer text-gray-darker" data-tracking-parent="edm-entry-global-footer"><div class="container-fluid bg-faded invisible"><div class="container"><div class="join-insider-container justify-content-between pt-2 pb-1_5 row" data-tracking-parent="edm-entry-insider-sign-up-footer"><div class="mb-1_25 mb-md-0 col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-5"><h2 class="heading-3 mb-0">Join Edmunds</h2><p class="mb-0">Receive pricing updates, shopping tips &amp;

is the best used car website?","answer":["Everyone will have an opinion, but we happen to think Edmunds is the best used car website. Edmunds has expert and consumer reviews, nationwide inventory, and pricing information to assist in determining a fair price to pay for your used car. If you're looking for used vehicles from private sellers, however, you might want to search elsewhere."]},{"question":"What used cars not to buy?","answer":["In general, you'll want to avoid used vehicles that have been issued a junk or salvage title, been in numerous accidents, or have a serious mechanical issue that needs attention. Edmunds does not have reliability data, so it is difficult to make a blanket assessment of specific models. There are a number of factors, such as age, maintenance history, and how the vehicle was driven, that play a role in determining a good car."]},{"question":"What are the cheapest used cars in USA?","answer":["You'll find used vehicles on Edmunds as low as $900. You'll want to sort the filter on the inventory page to the price range you want to look for, then sort by price from low to high. Keep in mind that cheap used cars might have items that need repair or they may have been in accidents. Make sure to get a vehicle history report and have the car inspected by a mechanic before making a buying decision."]},{"question":"How do I find the best car?","answer":["The best car for you is one that is in good condition and in your price range and one that fits the utility needs for you and your family. You can determine if it's the right one by checking the vehicle's vehicle history report, getting it inspected by a mechanic, and test-driving the vehicle.
